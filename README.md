This repository contains all the Oracle APEX applications I have developed, showcasing my practical experience in building data-driven web applications using Oracle APEX, SQL, and PL/SQL.
Each project demonstrates different aspects of APEX development, including interactive reports, forms, dynamic actions, process automation, validations, and database logic.
These applications reflect my hands-on work in designing UI components, implementing business logic, and integrating APEX pages with SQL and PL/SQL to deliver efficient and scalable solutions.
